# Jet Engine Health Monitoring System for Predictive Maintenance

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **university group project** developed at **Sejong University** for the course **Basic Design (Introduction to Industrial Project)**, supervised by **Professor Abolghasem Sadeghi-Niaraki**.

Our objective was to design and implement a **Jet Engine Health Monitoring System** using the **NASA C-MAPSS FD004 Dataset**, which is known for its complex and noisy data. The system estimates the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of jet engines for **predictive maintenance**, aiming to reduce risk and increase reliability in real-world applications.
